### Tempe Town Lake

This repository houses the workflow for publishing Dr. Hilairy Hartnett's long-term monitoring of water quality in Tempe Town Lake. Snapshots of data are provided by Dr. Hartnett at periodic intervals. As the updates do not overlap with previous measurements, the workflow is to harvest TTL data already in EDI then add the new observations to the existing.

As of `knb-lter-cap.630.4`, this workflow has been discontinued in light of the transition to measurements being collected instead with a Eureka datasonde ([data](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?scope=knb-lter-cap&identifier=712) and [workflow](https://gitlab.com/caplter/knb-lter-cap.712)).
