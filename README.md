Tempe Town Lake

This repository houses the workflow for publishing Dr. Hilairy Hartnett's long-term monitoring of water quality in Tempe Town Lake. Snapshots of data are provided by Dr. Hartnett at periodic intervals. As the updates do not overlap with previous measurements, the workflow is to harvest TTL data already in EDI then add the new observations to the existing.

- This workflow is specific to processed data. Please see Dropbox/ASU/tempe_town_lake for details regarding a first-pass processing of the raw Shimadzu data.
